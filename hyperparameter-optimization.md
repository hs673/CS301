The evolution method uses the search space to intialize random populations of simple, trained models called individuals. Two random individuals will be compared against each other for fitness (accuracy) using a separate validation set, and the least fit individual will be eliminated and removed from the population. The remaining individual will become a parent and undergo reproduction to create a child, which is a copy of the parent with a random mutation from a predetermined set. The mutation is what allows the each geneartion to find the potential optimal hyperparameters for our model. The child will be trained using the validation set and put back into the population to be compared again. In this method, we use tournament style selection to find the optimal models through each generation. Because each models in the population for each generation must be trained, this method is expensive, time consuming, and requires many trials.

To incorporate hyperparameter optimization on our dataset, we used the NNI API to implement the evolution method. We created a search space to define the hyperparameters and a configure file to specify the evolution tuner and the trial code. The NNI trial was not able to run because it ran out of memory even with a reduced search space.
