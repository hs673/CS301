To incorporate hyperparameter optimization on our dataset, we used the NNI API to implement the evolution method. The evolution method uses the search space to intialize random populations of trained models. Two random models will be compared against each other for fitness (accuracy), and the least fit model will be eliminated and removed from the population. The remaining model will become a parent and undergo reproduction to create a child, which is a copy of the parent with a random mutation. The mutation is what allows the models to generate the potential optimal hyperparameters for our model through each generation. The child will be trained using the validation set and put back into the population to be compared again.
